# rofi-todoist
## WARNING: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. 
This is a work-in-progress rofi tool written in bash for viewing, adding, completing, and modifying Todoist tasks using https://github.com/sachaos/todoist. 

It's kind working enough now. Not 100% usable yet. See TODO at the top of the script's code for future features.
